                        Context switching in lpel-nopcl
===============================================================================


The context switching API consists of two functions:

- create a new context, with a given function, argument, stack address,
  stack size


  mctx_create(mctx_t *mctx, void *func, void *arg, char *sk_addr, long sk_size)


- switch to another context, while storing the current context

  mctx_switch(mctx_t *octx, mctx_t *nctx)




i386 and x86_64 (AMD64)
=======================

internal functions

ctx_init_internal(ctx_addr, stack_end_addr, entry_func, arg)
ctx_swap_internal(old_ctx_addr, new_ctx_addr)


mctx_t is a single pointer (void *)

for swap:

callee saved registers need to be saved and restored

  1. push callee saved registers onto stack
  2. store stack pointer in old_ctx
  3. replace stack pointer by new_ctx
  4. pop callee saved registers from stack
  5. return (return address is on stack)



for init:

Prepare the new stack so that it fits the procedure of the
second half of swap for the first context switch to the new context.

entry_func is never called, instead, the ctx_swap_internal() routine
'returns' to the entry_func, hence entry_func is written on the new stack
to act as a return address for ctx_swap_internal().
Stack layout upon entering entry_func needs to look exactly like as if
entry_func is called from within another function.

Adjust stack pointer to account for popping off callee saved registers
(although they are not meaningful as entry_func_addr has no caller).

That also means that the entry_func must NEVER return (no meaningful return
address)!
Switch to a different context and, if desired, free the space for for the
entry_func context.



In following stack layouts, addresses are relative to the stack end address.

AMD64 stack layout (init)
------------------------

%rdi contains first argument of a function,
%rsi the second argument

%r12-%r15, %rbx, %rbp are the callee-saved registers.

(Parameter 'arg' needs to be held in register)


-56   r15
-48   r14
-40   r13
-32   r12
-24   rbx
-16   rbp
 -8   rdi (arg)
  0   return address (entry func)

For the swap routine, %rdi is pushed onto the stack, then the callee-saved
registers. They are popped in reverse order.

Popping %rdi is only meaningful for the first time switching to a newly
created context. Upon 'returning' to entry func, the argument will be
present in %rdi as required by the AMD64 calling conventions, just
as if entry_func is called from within another function.
(In all other cases, the caller of ctx_swap_internal() will, if needed,
save and restore %rdi.)

On the other hand, restoring callee-saved registers is only meaningful
in all but the first time switching to a context.

Hence, creating a new context consists of writing entry func and arg, and
storing the by -56 offset stack end address in the context.




i386 stack layout (init)
-------------------------

Parameters are always stored on the stack.
par1 in  4(%esp)
par2 in  8(%esp)
par3 in 12(%esp)
...

%ebp, %ebx, %esi, %edi are the callee saved registers.


-24   edi
-20   esi
-16   ebx
-12   ebp
 -8   return address (entry func)
 -4   fake return address of entry func
  0   arg

Parameter arg is an address below (fake) return address.
After 'returning' to entry_func, %esp points to -4,
and arg is accessed through 4(%esp) as required.

Note: Usually the prolog would push the %ebp onto the stack and store the
resulting %esp in %ebp. This way, all parameters could be accessed via the
%ebp, such that par1 is 8(%ebp), par2 is 12(%ebp) etc.

In -4, usually the return address of entry_func is expected (by entry_func).
Again, there is uninitialized memory and entry_func must never return!



Other context switching routines
--------------------------------

PowerPC: no arbitrary stack growth
- callee saved registers, and maybe arg need to be also stored in context
  (besides stack pointer)
